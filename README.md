- 👋 Hi, I’m @NSchikofsky
- 🏢 I currently work as a software engineer at Cosmos Versicherung AG in Germany
- 🌐 I can speak German (native), English (C1) and technically French (B1) [If you decide to contact me in French, don't expect a coherent response 😅]
- 👀 I’m interested in working on SPAs using Typescript, react and associated technologies or BFFs in Java/C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (occasionally), the basics of software testing and test engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything as long as it has a goal I can identify with.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I acively decided against taking programming classes in High School beacause I wanted to focus on other steam subjects (mostly physics)
     It took until the third semesters at Uni, working on becoming an Engineer, to finally figure out that I should become a programmer
